frontend-nanodegree-arcade-game
===============================

This game is a frogger clone I created while completing the U
dacity frontend nanodegree.

To run the game, open the index.htm file in your browser.

The only controls are the up, down, left, and right arrow keys on your keyboard.  

You can start at any time, with the goal of reaching the water without colliding into a bug.

If you collide with a bug, you will get an alert saying "Oh no! Try again!" and the character will go back to his starting point.

If you reach the water, you will get an alert saying "You win!" and the character will also go back to the starting point so that you can play again.
